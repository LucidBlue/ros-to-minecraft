modified version of SpockBot physics.py
changed the walk, sprint, jump functions to a single move function for code clarity

more importantly, it allows for single movements that are composites of
different motions (e.g. jump while walking northeast)

does not directly impact any data. calculates a new vector
which the client can use at its discretion

# documentation for SpockBot physics plugin
"""
PhysicsPlugin is planned to provide vectors and tracking necessary to implement
SMP-compliant client-side physics for entities. Primarirly this will be used to
keep update client position for gravity/knockback/water-flow etc. But it should
also eventually provide functions to track other entities affected by SMP
physics

Minecraft client/player physics is unfortunately very poorly documented. Most of
these values are based of experimental results and the contributions of a
handful of people (Thank you 0pteron!) to the Minecraft wiki talk page on
Entities and Transportation. Ideally someone will decompile the client with MCP
and document the totally correct values and behaviors.
